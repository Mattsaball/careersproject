However, I was studying abroad in London and didn’t want anyone to get charged for doing an international phone call. I emailed SEO about the situation and got no response. Then, I decided to contact the recruiter on LinkedIn to see if we could still set up an interview in another way.

For the residential counselor experience, I did a group interview over Zoom after applying online. I’m not sure what made me stand out more than other applicants for that role, I just tried to be genuine and show my honest interest in meeting and advising the incoming students at Columbia.

Instead I just like to meet new people at events, ask them their name, what they do, introduce myself and what I do. After that, just being curious about them and trying to figure out what kind of person they are is my form of “networking.” I’ve gotten LinkedIn connections who I keep up with, and though I can’t say I’ve gotten a referral, I’ve gotten email templates and advice from professionals, honest conversations, and honestly answered questions.

I learned to take a lot more risks and push myself to be well rounded in areas like leadership or dependability because those are the traits that matter to any team regardless of discipline. \n\nIt also really helps to have a passion to fall back on and to motivate you to keep going. I never took a single CS class in highschool but I love video games so I taught myself how to code (in C# with Unity) by looking for workshops and finding people to build projects with.

I think a lot of people forget that discipline and consistency exists in all areas. Find niches and stick to them.\n\nI’d also encourage people to take the road less traveled and to not be afraid to be different or stand out. I’ve always had trouble making friends and even on campus I only know 1 other person pursuing what I want to pursue. For a while I was really confused and it hurt to not have a ton of people to relate to or to lean on. I’ve built a stronger relationship with myself and I’ve learned a lot about my values by remaining independent and reassuring myself. "
