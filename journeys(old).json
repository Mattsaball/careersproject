    "postGradPlans": "barista until I get an archival/registration or collections-focused job in a museum or cultural institution-- and I'm pretty sure most art history majors are in the same boat",
    "careerPath": "I was in several theater productions at Columbia my freshman and sophomore year, but auditioning for and actually doing them became way too much of a time commitment with too little benefit to my career path. I focused more on being an illustrator for Spec, which I've used to beef up my marketing/communications/design skills. I interned for two archives, one over the summer and one for a full school year, both of which I got paid for through the Beyond Barnard Internship Program (cannot plug enough). Breaking into museum internships can be really hard-- don't let anyone tell you otherwise-- and I got my first one senior spring, but it has been the most useful for my career growth so far.",
    "freshmanAdvice": "#1 Ask people who majored in what you are studying about their jobs. Really think hard about the career you can create from your major, how hard it is to break into certain industries, and how much you would click with different positions available. Think about the rhythm of life you want-- do you want to grind super hard in your twenties? Do you want a corporate 9-5 routine? Do you want something creative and spontaneous? Do you want to move around a lot? Are you okay with doing contract work or shorter-term jobs with less benefits and/or security?\n#2 Get the info for #1 by connecting with Barnard and Columbia upperclassmen and alumni on LinkedIn/career center and on campus! Be brave and ask for things! It seems scary, but imagine if someone from your high school wanted to ask you about your college-- you'd jump up to help. Suss out the vibes of different industries and positions in these conversations; ask about companies/institutions to apply to, places with projects alumni think might interest you, and which places are doing the next big thing. For humanities especially, also attend talks and events on campus and at nearby universities, and introduce yourself to people and meet scholars or industry professionals whose work interests you. Email them after the event and ask to meet and chat.",
    "skillsToFocus": "For Museum work, professional communication skills are #1. Tbh most people who work in museums are bit unpleasant, so being friendly-- and professional-- gets you FAR.\nFor library/archive/collections-focused art world work, getting an internship where you can use the software and hands-on registration systems is key. Primarily TMS is the most important, but getting a variety of software exposure beefs up your applications.",
    "shortcuts": "#1 hack is take the time to write good cover letters. Super important for the humanities. It's a hot take but DO NOT USE AI for cover letters-- they're dry, un-engaging, and don't show off any of your writing skills.\n#2 is to apply to places that have had Columbia/Barnard interns recently. Reach out to the recent intern to ask them about their experience when you apply, and then reference chatting to that intern in an interview or even your cover letter.\n#3 is to build relationships with your academic advisor and professors. It's not much emphasized at this institution, but building those relationships (going to office hours, taking their classes and really engaging, emailing with them, asking about their work and upcoming lectures or projects, etc. you could attend) gets you good letters of recommendation and good advice in the long run.\n#4 is to USE THE CAREER CENTER. I have less experience with Columbia's but Beyond Barnard is an amazing resource, even if it can seem scary at times. Have them look over your application materials, do practice interviews, chat about strategies to find jobs, etc. And, send your application materials to connections you've made in the industry as well to get second opinions!",
    "additionalAdvice": "#1-- Don't let your success in the job market affect your self-esteem. The rules of how things are done, especially in the art world, are arbitrarily set by people trying to make the most money possible. Navigating these rules is important but tripping up does not make you a failure-- it makes you human. And secretly everyone wants candidates with more humanity!\n#2-- write a year-long senior thesis. Especially if you have less internships under your belt, this will give you experience in research, communication, writing, presenting, and shifting course with critique. And it will give you something to talk about in interviews!\n#3-- if you're looking for art jobs and struggling with finding something in New York, look elsewhere. Especially for smaller museums and more rural areas-- if you can get housing to intern there, or do it virtually, these organizations have smaller applicant pools and smaller teams that will teach you more, focus on you more, and help you more in the long run."

Also, ask your professors and other people about their tactics for reading large amounts of papers, or how they sift through research papers, they all have some strategy. Try some out. \n\nSystem level thinking is also important. Learn how to re -parameterize your problems and projects into systems with clear responses to impulses. If you can learn basics from research papers and think about the general systems that people are working on, you can strike up lots of conversations where you will learn a lot. \n\nIn terms of technical skills, take a statistical mechanics or electronic properties of materials class.

If you want to go to grad school, do your best to try to go to a conference. Join the AIChE club, or have good research to present at a conference. The conferences are a really great opportunity to meet people. Go up to people, and also work to try and see them a second time to make your initiative clear. \n\nAgain, I have very little industry experience. I got my job through a boss I had worked for in the past.",
    "additionalAdvice": "It will work out the way it is supposed to. You will find mentors that are the right fit for you. If you work hard to reach out and meet people, you will find a good fit and this can make all the difference. But also, lots of the time it won't work out. Some talks are not for you, and some speakers don't want to talk. Keep putting yourself out there and meeting people, and you will end up with the right fit. Also, don't take rejections for conversations or working in a lab personally, you will end up where you will be the most impactful and happiest. \n\nFinally, try lots of things out. You might think you like one part of ChemE or engineering, but the fields are super broad. Talk to people from all corners of the disciple, and try out as many types as you can. You will find something that suits you. But if you don't, that's also fine, because there's lots of other people and types of research or jobs out there."
